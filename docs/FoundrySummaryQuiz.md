- Which Foundry command generates a detailed debug coverage report and redirects the output to a file named `coverage.txt`? `forge coverage --report debug > coverage.txt`
- When analyzing a captured event log structure (e.g., Foundry's `Vm.Log`), where is the Keccak-256 hash of the event's signature located? `In the first element (``topics[0]``) of the ``topics`` array.`
- When accessing recorded event data using `vm.getRecordedLogs()` in Foundry, how is indexed event data accessed? ``Through the `topics` array within a specific log entry (e.g., `entries[i].topics[j]`).``
- In Foundry tests, which cheatcode combination is used to capture and retrieve emitted events for verification? ``vm.recordLogs()` followed by `vm.getRecordedLogs()``
- What is the primary goal of fuzz testing? `To identify defects and vulnerabilities by providing a range of potentially invalid or unexpected inputs.`
- In Foundry tests, which cheatcode or combination of cheatcodes allows simulating a transaction from a specific address pre-funded with a certain amount of ETH? `hoax(address, uint256)`
- When writing a comprehensive 'happy path' test for a smart contract function that distributes funds and updates state, what types of assertions are essential? `Assertions verifying the final balances of involved addresses and the final values of relevant state variables.`
- How can a Foundry script securely access a private key stored as an environment variable, for instance, to interact with a testnet? ``Using the `vm.envUint(\"PRIVATE_KEY_VARIABLE\")` cheatcode.``
- A developer wants to test how their new code interacts with existing systems deployed on a public network, but prefers to run these tests locally using a snapshot of the network's state. Which testing technique is most suitable? `Forked Testing` 
- In the context of the EVM, what is the fundamental role of an \"opcode\"? `It represents a single, primitive instruction that the EVM can execute directly.`
- When using `forge test --debug`, what specific low-level elements of EVM execution can be inspected sequentially? `OPCODES.`
